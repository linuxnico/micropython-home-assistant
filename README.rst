MicroPython Home Assistant
==========================

Communicate with your Home Assistant instance from MicroPython. Developed for and tested with MicroPython on the ESP8266.

Embeds a slightly patched version of `micropython http-client <https://github.com/balloob/micropython-http-client>`_.

Usage instructions
------------------

This has been tested to work with the alpha version of MicroPython for ESP8266 distributed among the backers of their KickStarter. Follow the instructions in their e-mail to get your ESP8266 up and running with their alpha version.

The alpha version does not have a filesystem so you'll have to copy/paste the code into the REPL. Press `ctrl+E` to put the REPL into paste-mode. Press `ctrl+d` to end paste-mode and process pasted code.

Copy the contents of `__init__.py <https://github.com/balloob/micropython-home-assistant/blob/master/homeassistant/__init__.py>`_ to the REPL. You can copy all constants at once but copy the classes and methods at root level one by one.

You're now all set and can follow the example below.

API
---

Constructor:

- ``HomeAssistant(host_url, token=None, timeout=None)``

Methods:

- ``states()``
- ``is_state(entity_id, state)``
- ``get_state(entity_id)``
- ``set_state(entity_id, state, attributes=None)``
- ``fire_event(event_name, event_data=None)``
- ``call_service(domain, service, service_data=None)``

.. code-block:: python

    from homeassistant import HomeAssistant
    hass = HomeAssistant('http://127.0.0.1:8123', 'my_api_token')
    states = hass.states()
    state = states[0]
    print("State %s is %s" % (state['entity_id'], state['state']))
    print("Test if state is still the same: %s" %
          hass.is_state(state['entity_id'], state['state']))

    new_state = hass.set_state('sensor.temperature', '10',
                               {'unit_of_measurement': '%'})
    verify_state = hass.get_state('sensor.temperature')
    print(new_state)
    print(verify_state)
    print(new_state == verify_state)

    hass.fire_event('some_event', {'hello': 'world'})

    hass.call_service('switch', 'turn_on', {'entity_id': 'switch.ac'})

Discovery
---------

This currently only works on the Unix MicroPython version.

It is able to automatically detect a running instance of Home Assistant on the network if the server is running the experimental `discoverable <https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant/blob/discoverable/homeassistant/components/discoverable.py>`_ component.

By default the Home Assistant server will not expose it's password. In this case to get a working instance you have to pass a password to ``get_instance('my password')``.

.. code-block:: python

    from homeassistant.discovery import get_instance

    hass = get_instance()

Notes
-----

- SSL certificates are not being verified.
- Not all micropython implementations support timeout. It defaults to 5 seconds
  if supported. It can be overwritten by passing in a second argument to the
  ``HomeAssistant`` constructor.
